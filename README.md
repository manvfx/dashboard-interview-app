# React Dashboard with Drag & Drop and Resizable Widgets

A modern, customizable dashboard built with React, featuring drag & drop reordering and resizable widgets. This project uses [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) for drag and drop functionality and [react-rnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rnd) for widget resizing. State management is handled via Redux.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Rearrange widgets within a dashboard using dnd-kit.
- **Column Layout**: Widgets are arranged in a two-column layout.
- **State Persistence**: Widget order is managed via Redux (and can be stored in localStorage if needed).
